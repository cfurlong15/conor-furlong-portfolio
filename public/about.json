    "bio": "I'm a Software Engineer with a specific appreciation for quality backend programming. Prior to my SE education, I spent two years as a Content Marketer in the EdTech industry, where I worked with established educational content providers to build upon and present their brands to wider audiences. While in marketing, I created several websites alongside software engineers where I provided the copy, and they executed the design and functionality. Seeing their work, I soon discovered that I had a passion for what they do, and have since pursued a career in tech for myself.",
    "bio2": "My leadership skills, desire to learn, and ongoing understanding of what makes a solid application have proven to be strong motivators in my path towards a software engineering career. After a three month immersive course and several high level projects, I look forward to kicking off this chapter of my career. My skills include a wide range of full-stack development must-haves, but my strongest areas are in Python, PostgreSQL, and JavaScript.."
